SYNOPSIS
      use SMS::Send;

      my $sender = SMS::Send->new("UK::AA",
        _login    => '0123xxxxxx',
        _password => 'secret');

      my $sent = $sender->send_sms(
        text => 'y u no txt bak',
        to   => '+44 7xxx xxxxx'
      );

      if($sent) {
        say "Message successfully sent";
      }

DESCRIPTION
    This is a SMS::Send compatible module that sends using the UK based
    provider Andrews and Arnold Ltd <http://aa.net.uk> (A&A). You will need
    a VoIP account with A&A in order to use this module.

METHODS
  send_sms
    Sends an SMS. The return value will evaluate in boolean context to a
    false value, but will stringify to a useful message. It also has a
    "status_line" method which will return a one line status.

PARAMETERS
    Certain private parameters not part of SMS::Send's API are implemented
    by this module. They all begin with an underscore ("_"). See the A&A
    docs for full details if not explained here.

  Constructor parameters
    *   _login

        If using a VoIP line, must be provided, your A&A VoIP username
        (usually your phone number). Not required for direct to SIM
        delivery.

    *   _password

        Must be provided, either the password associated with the above, or
        the SMS password configured along with your SIM.

    *   _endpoint

        Set to the URI of an endpoint implementing this interface if a
        different endpoint to the default is needed. This module defaults to
        "https://sms.aa.net.uk/sms.cgi", if for some reason SSL doesn't work
        for you, you might want to set it to the non-SSL version.

    *   _ssl_verify

        Set to a false value to disable SSL verification. This will
        automatically be disabled if you supply a HTTP URI above.

  "send_sms" parameters
    These parameters may be provided to either the constructor or the
    "send_sms" method.

    *   _limit

        Limit number of parts.

    *   _costcentre

        Reported on XML bill.

    *   _private

        Do not show the text on the bill.

    *   _oa

        Set a specific sender.

    *   _originator

        Set a specific sender (same as oa, for backwards compatiblity).

    *   _udh

        User data header, in hex.
