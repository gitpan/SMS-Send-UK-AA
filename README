        _login    => '0123xxxxxx',
        _password => 'secret');

DESCRIPTION
    This is a SMS::Send compatible module that sends using the UK based
    provider Andrews and Arnold Ltd <http://aa.net.uk> (A&A). You will need
    a VoIP account with A&A in order to use this module.

PARAMETERS
    Certain private parameters not part of SMS::Send's API are implemented
    by this module. They all begin with an underscore ("_"). See the A&A
    docs for full details if not explained here.

  Constructor parameters
    *   _login

        Must be provided, your A&A VoIP username.

    *   _password

        Must be provided, password associated with the above.

    *   _endpoint

        Set to the URI of an endpoint implementing this interface if a
        different endpoint to the default is needed. This module defaults to
        "https://sms.aa.net.uk/sms.cgi", if for some reason SSL doesn't work
        for you, you might want to set it to the non-SSL version.

    *   _ssl_verify

        Set to a false value to disable SSL verification. This will
        automatically be disabled if you supply a HTTP URI above.

  "send_sms" parameters
    These parameters may be provided to either the constructor or the
    "send_sms" method.

    *   _limit

        Limit number of parts.

    *   _sendtime

        Specify a time in the future to send the message.

    *   _replace

        Replace a previous message from this originator.

    *   _flash

        *Flash* the message on the phone's screen.

    *   _report

        URL or email of where to send a delivery report.

    *   _costcentre

        Reported on XML bill.

    *   _private

        Do not show the text on the bill.

    *   _originator

        Set a specific sender.

    *   _udh

        User data header, in hex.

    *   _iccid

        Send to a specific SIM -- you'll also need to specify the "to" field
        as this in order for SMS::Send to be happy.
